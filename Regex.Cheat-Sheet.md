# Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions are notoriously difficult to learn - they have a very compact syntax that ends up looking like gibberish. However, they can be extremely powerful when it comes to form validation, find and replace tasks, and/or searching through a body of text. The following cheatsheet provides common RegEx examples and techniques for the JavaScript developer.

ðŸ”¥ There are several awesome tools that can help you debug RegEx in the browser - my personal favorite is RegExr (regex.com).

# Regex Reference

## Basics

- `/ expression / flags`, i.e `/[A-Z]+/g` basic format
- `/ hello\?\*\\/` escape special characters with backslashes
- `()` group with parentheses
